      "title1": "How to Build Audience Loyalty? 10 Tips for Writing Professional and Smart Content",
      "desc": "Great content is the best sales tool in the world, with these words, Marcus Sheridan, a prominent American marketing consultant, opened one of his interviews to explain the importance of content marketing in attracting customers and increasing sales. But isn't that a bit exaggerated?",
      "desctitle1": "Currently the majority of consumers use search engines like Google and Bing  as well as social media platforms to find the answers they need in almost every aspect of their daily lives. 62% of the world's population uses the internet, compared to only 46.8% in 2017. Among these user  93.3% use social media platforms daily spending an average of two hours and 24 minutes. It's also worth noting that Facebook has 2.9 billion monthly active users, followed by YouTube with 2.3 billion users while the current global population stands at 8 billion people.",
      "desctitle2": "Creating successful marketing content has become an essential part of the digital marketing process. If you succeed in writing and producing professional and engaging content, you can convert your website visitors from mere readers into loyal and devoted customers. But why do some companies achieve greater success in content marketing compared to other companies that have their own content?",
      "desctitle3": "Here are the key points on how to create digital content that enhances your brand identity and encourages more customers to use your services:",
      "title2": "1. Select your target audience carefully.",
      "desc2title": "Before starting to write any content, you need to have a clear picture of your target audience. Who is your target demographic? What are the problems they face? What type of content captures their attention and resonates with their reality and needs? Why are they hesitant to purchase your products and services? What do they say to your sales team? What do they say about your business on social media? By finding accurate answers to these questions, you will ensure that your carefully crafted content meets their needs and has a greater power to reach and engage as many of them as possible.",
      "desc3title": "To obtain answers, conduct customer surveys through email, engage with customers on your social media platforms, and consult your team members about customer feedback and desires.",
      "title3": "2.Identify your goals",
      "desctitles": "When you know what you want to achieve through your content, it becomes easier to design and create content and topics that support your goals. It's important to initially focus on two or three goals at most, such as: building trust with your audience, attracting new customers, solving problems for existing customers, highlighting the benefits of your products, building customer loyalty, and developing new ideas for your products.",
      "desctitles1": "For example, if the product or service you offer is somewhat new and known only to a few people, it would be illogical to focus your content solely on convincing customers to make a purchase. Instead, you should initially create informative content that helps customers understand the services you provide and how it can help them solve their problems.",
      "title4": "3. Utilize storytelling in your marketing efforts.",
      "desct1": "By marketing through storytelling, you can connect with people's hearts, not just their minds, and help them understand their problems and the solutions you offer on a deeper level. This approach is highly effective and widely used by major corporations such as Apple and Microsoft to build communities of loyal customers.",
      "desct2": "The renowned psychologist Jerome Bruner has demonstrated that using storytelling to convey a message makes people remember those stories up to 22 times more than facts and figures alone. According to another study published in the Harvard Business Review, emotional connections are crucial in building brand loyalty and serve as a key indicator of future customer value. Additionally, customers typically recommend brands they have an emotional connection with to others.Let me further illustrate this with a short story...",
      "desct3": "In 2009, a journalist named Rob Walker from the New York Times magazine conducted a fascinating experiment. He purchased 200 online products from the popular auction website eBay for just $129. These products included room keys, plastic horse heads, and other low-value items, with an average price of around $1.25 each.Afterwards, he re-listed the products for sale on the website but added a short story for each item. The result was astounding! He was able to sell the same products for over $8,000! Can you believe it? He even sold the plastic horse head for $60, while its original price was less than a dollar. Tell your community honestly the story of your organization and its products, and how they emerged dramatically, bringing them closer to their emotions. Capture their feelings and connect them to your products and brand.",
      "title5": "Utilize images and videos to enhance your storytelling.",
      "desct4": "The English proverb says, A picture is worth a thousand words, and this is because as humans, we are wired to respond more to visual content than written content. For thousands of years, we have relied on visual cues to understand the world around us and exchange complex ideas more quickly and clearly. As a result, our brains process visual information up to 60,000 times faster than textual information. Therefore, visual content should form a significant part of your marketing strategy.",
      "desct5": "Studies have shown that ordinary individuals remember about 65% of information when it is accompanied by a relevant image, compared to only 10% without an image. And if an image is included in the content, understanding increases from 70% to 95%.",
      "desct6": "In addition, your audience will be more willing to share your content, as evidenced by the following statistic:",
      "list1": "Visual content is shared on social media platforms 40 times more than written content.",
      "list2": "Facebook posts accompanied by images receive a 2.3 times higher share rate.",
      "list3": "Tweets with images receive 150% more retweets than those without images.",
      "list4": "Posts containing videos attract approximately 300% more backlinks.",
      "list5": "Landing pages with videos increase the conversion rate by 86%.",
      "title6": "So, how do we choose the appropriate images?",
      "listdesc": "When choosing the appropriate image for your content on social media platforms, there are several factors to consider:",
      "list6": "Compatibility with the Content: The image should be relevant and reflect the message of the content. Choose an image that enhances the concept or idea you want to convey.",
      "list7": "Compatibility with the Content: The image should be relevant and reflect the message of the content. Choose an image that enhances the concept or idea you want to convey.",
      "list8": "Professionalism: The image should be high-quality and free from any technical flaws. Ensure the image is clear, detailed, and gives a professional impression.",
      "list9": "Platform Fit: Make sure to select an image that aligns with the requirements and formats of the platform you will be posting on. Ensure it matches the recommended size and aspect ratio for each platform",
      "list10": "Respect Copyright: Ensure that the image you choose is available for public use and does not violate copyright laws. You can use free images or obtain licensed images from trusted sources.",
      "list11": "Testing and Response Analysis: Experiment with different images and measure the performance of each image by tracking views and interactions. Rely on analytics to determine which image achieves the best performance and engages the audience."

      "desc": "Companies are a fundamental pillar of the economy and development, contributing to the creation of new employment opportunities and providing the necessary products and services for daily life. However, the success of companies is not guaranteed, as many of them face failure and closure. The reasons for this failure can be attributed to several factors, including poor management, intense competition, and possibly a lack of sufficient funding.In this article, we will discuss the common reasons for business failure and highlight the crucial importance of community building and effective marketing in the success of these companies.",
      "title2": "1. Causes of business failure:",
      "desc1": "Before explaining these reasons, you should know that the latest statistics released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that nearl20% of startups fail in the first year, and this percentage reaches 50% within just five years. Isn't that a significant proportion?In reality, there are many reasons and challenges that can lead your startup to failure and potentially make you one of those who lose at the beginning of the journey. Some of the most important reasons include:",
      "list1": "Insufficient funding: New projects require a significant amount of capital to start and sustain operations.",
      "list2": "Poor management and a lack of clear strategy and vision for achieving success.",
      "list3": "Strong competition from similar companies, which weakens your position in the market.",
      "list4": "Ineffective and poorly planned marketing efforts.",
      "list5": "Inability to build a loyal customer community for your product.",
      "title3": "2. The importance of marketing and community building for the success of your company cannot be overstated.",
      "desc2t": "Many entrepreneurs face a problem in understanding the crucial role of marketing and building a loyal customer community, which leads them to failure even if they have a high-quality product compared to their competitors. It is surprising to imagine that only 2% of companies genuinely prioritize social media as an effective means of communicating with customers!",
      "desc3t": "Simply put, when companies invest more time and effort in effectively communicating with their customers, it helps them analyze their goals and understand the needs of potential customers. As a result, they can identify the best ways to attract them, expand their reach, and ultimately increase their sales, which is the primary objective of almost any project.",
      "desc4t": "Furthermore, building a loyal customer community significantly contributes to your success. When customers feel a sense of belonging to the company's community, they become more loyal and encourage others to join as well. When customers interact with each other and feel like they are part of an active community, they fundamentally foster the growth of the company. Some companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, and Amazon have implemented effective marketing and community-building strategies that have resulted in remarkable success.",
      "title4": "3. But do you know what is the common factor among those companies?",
      "desc0t": "Professor Gerald Zaltman from Harvard University states that 95% of customer purchasing decisions are based on emotional reasons, and this is exactly what those companies focus on. And you might be surprised to learn that successful companies are not concerned with attracting new customers.",
      "desct": "As much as they care about retaining their current customers, they do so by providing excellent post-sales service, offering special promotions from time to time, and providing various platforms that allow customers to share their feedback with the company. This feedback is then used to improve the user experience and ultimately increase sales. This helps build a strong and almost personal relationship between the company and the customer, who will undoubtedly seek their services again.",
      "desttitle": "The answer lies in another principle upon which these companies build their marketing plans, which is the Pareto Principle. This principle states that 20% of customers in any company or organization are responsible for 80% of its future sales. Therefore, it is highly logical to focus on maintaining the loyalty and belonging of that small percentage, which is often overlooked by many reputation-damaged companies.",
      "desttitle1": "Unlike other companies that spend a lot of money acquiring a large base of new customers, companies like Coca-Cola and Apple are able to reach a larger percentage of customers entirely for free through what is known as word-of-mouth referrals. This involves leveraging their loyal customers to indirectly promote their products or services.",
      "desttitle2": "In addition to that, loyal customers are the lifeline on which these companies rely to navigate through economic crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. They also serve as a protective shield against new competitors, even if they are stronger.",
      "title5": "4. You may be asking yourself now, why do marketing campaigns of these giant companies focus on retaining existing customers rather than acquiring new ones?",
      "desc4": "One of the main reasons that hinder gaining customer loyalty is focusing solely on sales and neglecting the user experience, whether through offering a poor product or relying on unprofessional customer service that does not allow users to express their concerns or criticisms. Meanwhile, 64% of consumers expect personal interaction from companies, while 76% of them expect those companies to understand their needs and expectations. Ask yourself, what are the contemporary and effective tools through which the customer feels like a part of your institution's family and a valued entity?",
      "title6": " 5. Why do some companies fail to gain customer loyalty?",

It is also important to ensure that those goals are measurable, so you can apply Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to them, in order to measure the success of achieving those goals. To understand how to build a successful community, it is important to grasp the factors that contribute to creating a sense of unity and belonging within the members, akin to a family Psychologists have identified four key factors that are essential when attempting to build any community, regardless of its direction or purpose. These factors are: Influence: Community members should feel that their opinions have a direct and indirect impact on the decisions of their community and on other members. Otherwise, what is the point of their engagement?

The most important aspect of building an online community is creating a suitable plan for all these categories.For example, you cannot ask active users to reduce their engagement and encourage inactive users to participate if they do not wish to do so. However, what you can do is encourage everyone to interact in a way that suits and aligns with their preferences and interests. Duolingo, an online language learning platform, has successfully built a community that assists its target audience in learning various languages. They have achieved this by encouraging users to contribute to the educational course content and ensuring its quality.
